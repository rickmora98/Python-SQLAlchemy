# sqlalchemy-challenge 

This repository contains my solutions to Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework Assignment for week #10.

#### Files/Folders:

> *"climate.ipynt"* (jupyter notebook for part 1 of this assignment) <br>
> *"app.py"* (Flask app for part 2 of this assignment) <br>
> 
> **"Resources"** (data folder) <br>
>	- *"hawaii.sqlite"* (database file needed by *"climate.ipynt"* and *"app.py"*) <br>
> 	- *"hawaii_measurements.csv"* (optional data file if needed) <br>
> 	- *"hawaii_stations.csv"* (optional data file if needed) <br>

	
#### Note: <br>

The csv files in folder *"Resources"* are only needed if rebuilding the sqlite file from scratch. <br>
*"climate.ipynb"* and *"app.py"* both require that *"hawaii.sqlite"* be found in the *"Resources"* folder.<br>
Please do not delete or move this file. <br>
